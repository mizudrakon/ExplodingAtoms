# Exploding Atoms

This is my implementation of the game Exploding Atoms for a school project somewhere in 2017, I think...
It's a horrible mess of a code with names being either descriptive but not variable enough, or actually jokes on science-fiction-religion terms. 
It needs some redoing, and since I'm sharing it now, I aim to find some time to do it... I also wanted to finally make a functioning AI to play it.  
I'm not vary enthusiastic, since I haven't coded in C\# in a long while. I prefer C++, and I was also thinking about remaking this with wxWidgets instead of Forms, 
but not of it is a priority.
